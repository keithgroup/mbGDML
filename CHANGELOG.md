- Many-body alchemical parameter.

### Changed

- Unified use of ``Z``, ``z``, ``R``, and ``r``.
- `dataSet` to `DataSet`
- Switch to qcelemental for atom properties.
- Do not restrict ``sigma_bounds`` for Bayesian optimization after initial grid search.
- ``mbgdml.criteria`` is now ``mbgdml.descriptors`` with a modular handling of descriptors and cutoffs.
- Provide changeable ``Z``, ``R``, ``E``, and ``F`` keys for loading ``npz`` data sets.
- Modularize the error and loss calculations.
- Reduce regularization strength to ``1e-10`` instead of ``1e-15``.
- Split `predict` module into `models` and `predictors`.
- Install bayesian-optimization from git until scipy bug is fixed.
- Merged [sGDML](https://github.com/stefanch/sGDML) changes up to v0.5.4 (``124de3dd8d46a0622bd10c3b4ab033a00dbd3c27``).
- Predict times are logged at debug level.
- Ray must be initialized outside of ``mbePredict`` class.
- Use ``n_workers`` instead of ``n_cores`` in mbePredict.

### Fixed

- ``mbe_worker`` with heterogeneous n-body structures (e.g., solute+solvent).
- Custom ``todict`` method for ASE calculator.
Fixes attached ASE trajectory in reading ``entity_ids``.
- Store ASE Atoms object to avoid recalculating energies and forces in ASE calculator.
- Doc references to respective SchNet functions.

### Removed

- Dependency on ``natsort``.
- ``mbgdml.data.mbModel`` was adsorbed into ``mbgdml.models.gdmlModel``.
- ``structureSets`` and sampling for data sets are no longer supported and subsequently removed.
This functionality was incorporated into [reptar](https://github.com/aalexmmaldonado/reptar).

## [0.0.3] - 2022-07-25

### Added

- [SchNetPack](https://schnetpack.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) prediction capabilities.
- [GAP](https://libatoms.github.io/GAP/index.html) prediction capabilities.
- Training loss function that includes a weighted energy RMSE component.
- Require integration constant evaluation option regardless of performance.
- Initial grid for Bayesian optimization to guide ``sigma_bounds``.
- Ability to keep all trained models instead of just the best one.
- Log parallel optimization.
- Plot Gaussian process from hyperparameter Bayesian optimization.
- Plot cluster losses and population histogram using matplotlib.
- Option to use a sequential reduction optimizer for Bayesian optimization.
- Specify Gaussian process keyword arguments for the final iterative training task.

### Changed

- Redesigned predict methods and parallelized with ray.
- Included a many-body expansion, ``mbe``, module to handle *n*-body energy and force predictions.
- Updated API documentation tree.
- Elements logging in tasks and models are condensed (i.e., no spaces).
- Default ``gp_params`` for Bayesian optimization.
- MD5 hashes are no longer stored in bytes.
- Do not include training set in any problematic clustering.

- Training JSON to ``training.json`` instead of ``log.json``.
- Iterative training task directory names to state the training set size.

### Fixed

- Added missed torchtools for GDML.
