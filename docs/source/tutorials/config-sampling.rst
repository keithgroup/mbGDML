Configurational sampling
========================

**Outcome**: Understand fragmentation schemes and techniques for generating/sampling structures to train ML potentials.

Like any other machine learning (ML) method, we need data to learn from.
For many-body ML (mbML) potentials, we need models for all possible 1-, 2-, and 3-body interactions.
Structures---eventually with energies and possibly forces---are needed to train on.
As we discussed :ref:`elsewhere <many-body expansions>`, many-body expansions make predictions of arbitrarily sized systems by summing up individual 1-, 2-, and 3-body contributions.
This means our data sets are composed of monomers, dimers, and trimers.

Fragmentation
=============

The monomers, dimers, and trimers we must sample are determined by how we define our entities (i.e., fragments).
Predicting structures later on will involve predicting energies and forces of :math:`n`-body fragment combinations.
We thus have to train ML potentials on all of these possible fragment combinations.
For example, here are some possible ways we can fragment some systems.

- **Pure water**: the best fragmentation scheme is having each water molecule be an entity.
    We would then need to sample configurations of one, two, and three water molecules.

- **Solute in water and methanol mixture**: each molecule would be a single entity.
    We would individually sample

    - solute, water, methanol monomers;
    - solute+water, solute+methanol, water+water, water+methanol, methanol+methanol dimers;
    - solute+water+water, solute+water+methanol, solute+methanol+methanol, water+water+water, water+water+methanol, water+methanol+methanol, methanol+methanol+methanol trimers.

    If using only ML potentials with global descriptors (e.g., GDML), you would need a single model for each combination listed above.
    Local atomic descriptors (e.g., GAP, SchNet) could be used for one or more combinations above.

- **Periodic gold slab with two adsorbates**: this becomes more complicated.
    On one hand, we could make the slab be one entity and the adsorbate another:

    - slab, adsorbate;
    - slab+adsorbate, adsorbate+adsorbate;
    - slab+adsorbate+adsorbate.
    
    We could also define a gold atom as an entity instead of the slab.
    This would result in

    - gold, adsorbate;
    - gold+gold, gold+adsorbate, adsorbate+adsorbate;
    - gold+gold+gold, gold+gold+adsorbate, gold+adsorbate+adsorbate.

    Both schemes are perfectly valid, but one could perform better than the other.

How we sample/generate these structures is the purpose of this tutorial.

Packing molecules
=================

TODO: Introduce packmol and use water as an example


Example: Water droplet
----------------------

`Packmol <http://leandro.iqm.unicamp.br/m3g/packmol/home.shtml>`_ is used to generate an initial structure for the simulation.
Since the `xtb program <https://xtb-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contents.html>`_ only has spherical confining potentials, we will generate a spherical droplet of water.
The Cartesian coordinates of a water monomer is needed for `Packmol <http://leandro.iqm.unicamp.br/m3g/packmol/home.shtml>`_.
Here is the `MP2/def2-TZVP optimized geometry of a water molecule <https://github.com/keithgroup/solute-solvent-clusters/tree/main/clusters/homogeneous/h2o/1h2o/1h2o.abc>`_ that we use called ``1h2o.abc.mp2.def2tzvp.xyz``.

.. code-block:: text

    O      0.000000    0.000000    0.216072
    H      0.000000    0.761480   -0.372151
    H      0.000000   -0.761480   -0.372151

.. warning::

    GDML models use global descriptors (specifically inverse internuclear distances).
    This means the order of the atoms matters, and every structure we want to predict has to provide the Cartesian coordinates in this order: the Oxygen atom, then the hydrogens.
    Because of symmetry we can specify the hydrogen atoms in any order.

    In a molecule such as methanol the methyl hydrogens are distinguishable---with respect to the hydroxyl group---and their order matters with respect to the hydroxyl group and rotation (i.e., clockwise or counterclockwise).
    However, just the rotational order of the hydrogens on acetonitrile would matter.

    Thus, setting the order of the atoms here, in the monomer structure, is highly recommended.

Now we can use `packmol <http://leandro.iqm.unicamp.br/m3g/packmol/home.shtml>`_ to generate a sphere with a diameter of, say, 20 Angstroms.
This size would ensure we can sample enough long-distance structures.
Using properties of the molecule (i.e., mass density and molar mass) we can compute the number of molecules to include for a 500 K droplet of water---this ends up being around 140 water molecules.
A `packmol <http://leandro.iqm.unicamp.br/m3g/packmol/home.shtml>`_ input file to generate this structure is shown below.
The resulting structure will look something like :download:`this xyz file<../files/tut-water/140h2o.pm.xyz>`.

    end structure


Molecular dynamics
==================

In production, systems are likely to have different intramolecular bond lengths and intermolecular distances.
Procedurally generating structures for anything more than individual atoms is computationally infeasible.
An easy way to accomplish this is by running molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.

Driving MD simulations with quantum chemistry ensures the most accurate sampling at a high computational cost.
Classical force fields dramatically accelerate these simulations, but parameters are not always available for species of interest.
Semiempirical quantum mechanics (SQM) methods offer a compromise of speed and generalizability to most chemical species of interest.


Example: xTB with water droplet
-------------------------------

One such example of a SQM method is `GFN2-xTB <https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b01176>`__.
The `xtb program <https://xtb-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contents.html>`__ drives MD simulation of a water droplet.
We will use a higher temperature, say 500 K, to help sample low- and high-energy configurations.


Minimizing the `packmol <http://leandro.iqm.unicamp.br/m3g/packmol/home.shtml>`_ structure ensures we have a reasonable starting structure.
Since we are using GFN2-xTB for the MD simulation, we first need to optimize it using the same level of theory.
We can do this with the `xtb program <https://xtb-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contents.html>`_ using the following command.
We will get something like :download:`the following structure<../files/tut-water/140h2o.pm.gfn2.xyz>`.

.. code-block:: bash

    xtb ./140h2o.pm.xyz --opt tight --gfn 2 --charge 0 --cycles 200

Now we are ready to run a GFN2-xTB simulation using the input file below named ``140h2o.pm.gfn2-xtb.md.eq1-gfn2.500k.wallpot.inp``.
Basically, this runs a 10 picosecond NVT simulation at 500 K with a 1 femtosecond integration time step to equilibrate the system.
A spherical confining potential is used to prevent dissociation during the run.

.. code-block:: text

    $md
        restart  = false
        time     =  10.0  # in ps (1000 fs = 1 ps; 1 fs = 0.001 ps)
        step     =   1.0  # in fs
        dump     =  50.0  # in fs
        temp     = 500.0  # in K
        nvt      = true
        velo     = false
        hmass    =   0    # 0 turns off alternative hydrogen mass
        shake    =   0
        sccacc   =   1.0
    $end

    $wall
        potential = logfermi
        sphere: auto, all
        temp = 300.0
        beta = 6
    $end

    $write
        wiberg=false
        dipole=false
        charges=false
        mulliken=false
        orbital energies=false
        inertia=false
        distances=false
        final struct=false
        geosum=false
    $end

With the optimized xyz structure, we start the simulation using the following command.

.. code-block:: bash

    xtb ./140h2o.pm.gfn2.xyz --md --input 140h2o.pm.gfn2-xtb.md.eq1-gfn2.500k.wallpot.inp --gfn 2 --charge 0 --verbose

After confirming the system is fully equilibrated we will run a production simulation.
We mostly reuse the previous output file and command with two changes.

- **Time of the simulation.**
  Instead we can run a simulation for 1 picosecond.
- **Manually specify the confining potential size.**
  Before, we had a line in the ``$wall`` block that states ``sphere: auto, all`` which automatically determines the radius of the sphere and applies it to all atoms.
  The size of the confining potential could change when restarting the simulation.
  Thus, manually specifying the radius, in Bohr, is recommended.
  The output file of the previous simulation will have a line that says something like ``spherical wallpotential with radius   11.5624559 Ã…``.
  We just have to convert this to Bohr, which is about ``21.84987498332`` and specify it like so: ``sphere: 21.84987498332, all``.
  
  .. note::
      One could also have specified a radius corresponding to the initial `packmol <http://leandro.iqm.unicamp.br/m3g/packmol/home.shtml>`_ shape instead of letting `xtb <https://xtb-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contents.html>`_ automatically determine it.
      The density of system usually significantly changes when the ``auto`` option is used.

With the :download:`production simulation trajectory<../files/tut-water/140h2o.pm.gfn2.md.500k.eq0-xtb.md.prod1-gfn2.500k.wallpot.xyz>` in hand we can being preparing a structure set.
