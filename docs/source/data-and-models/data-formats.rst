All data is stored in the `NumPy NPZ <https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.io.html#numpy-binary-files-npy-npz>`_ file format.
Each NZP file is given a unique MD5 fingerprint that is used to identify them and provide a breadcrumb trail.
We use the following sets of data with many-body GDML.
